# train-capacity
A program written for an imaginary train system.  It verifies if the amount of passengers is appropriate, depending on the train's capacity.

## Installation

No installations required. Just open the Java class in your IDE of choice (examples: Netbeans, Eclipse, IntelliJ).

## Usage

First, the program will ask you to fill in the train's capacity and the number of stations, as well as how many passengers got off, got in, or stayed at the station. You'll have to fill in the last three values as many times as there are stations. 
Once you've finished, the program will calculate whether boarding of more passengers is allowed or not. 

## Contributing

This was just a beginner's exercise in Java. No need for pull requests at the moment. 

## Acknowledgment

This program is based on the curriculum of the course "Programmering 1" by Folkuniversitetet (2021). Only used for educational purposes.
